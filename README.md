3. Configure your creators on `creators.csv`:

    ```

4. Run it!

    It will only save all the creator's posts to check if there is anything new in the next run
    ```console
    user@host:kemono_checker$ python3 main.py
    ```

    Now, if you run it, and you have something new from the creator, it should show something like this:
    ```console
    user@host:kemono_checker$ python3 main.py
    # New: Food has been great this season, date: 2023-12-22 15:56:21, url: https://kemono.party/patreon/user/58020585/post/95118501
    ```
    If you want to test if it's working, you can delete some posts from the cache, in the folder `logs/nameofcreator_service.csv`:
    ```csv
    title,date,url,image

5. Running it continuously

    Like an update checker, you want it to constantly check for something new, so we need it to run from time to time.

    ## On Linux:
    We have some options here in linux:
    - Crontab
    - Anacron
    - Systemd (Recommended)

    As in my tests it is the easiest and most reliable option, I will show you how to do it in **systemd**:

    First we create a `.service` file in `/etc/systemd/system/`:
    ```console
    user@host:kemono_checker$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/kemono_checker.service
    ```

    We need to create a service to run the file, there are many ways to do this, but let's do it simply
    ```console
    # GNU nano 7.2           /etc/systemd/system/kemono_checker.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Kemono Party Update Checker

    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    WorkingDirectory=/home/user/kemonoparty-checker
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/user/kemonoparty-checker/main.py
    ```

    Now we need to create a timer to run the service from time to time, we can do this with:
    ```console
    user@host:kemono_checker$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/kemono_checker.timer
    ```

    Here you can choose the time between each execution [**BE CAREFUL** not to set a time shorter than 10 minutes, you might end up being blocked by kemono's anti-DDOS]
    ```console
    # GNU nano 7.2           /etc/systemd/system/kemono_checker.timer
    [Unit]
    Description=Kemono Timer

    [Timer]
    OnUnitActiveSec=1800s
    OnBootSec=1800s

    [Install]
    WantedBy=timers.target
    ```

    Let's enable and start the service:
    ```console
    user@host:kemono_checker$ sudo systemctl enable kemono_checker.timer
    user@host:kemono_checker$ sudo systemctl start kemono_checker.timer
    ```

    Good job! Now everything is configured, and every X minutes the service should run, even if you restart your computer.

    ## On Windows:

    Well, I'm not a Windows user, so I don't know how to do it, but I believe there are several ways. I'm sure you can do it, I trust your potential!
